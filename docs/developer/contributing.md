## General
If you want to contribute you have two ways to do so

- If you just want to contribute one time to one of our projects fork it, commit on the fork and send a github pull request
- If you want to activly contribute join our discord, and ask if you can be added to github organization

You can also join our discord if you have single contribution or even if you dont have any to just talk with us.
